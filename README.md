# Lab 5 – UI Frameworks Demo
This lab explores Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and React.js fundamentals.  
Part 1 uses Bootstrap 5 to build a navbar, two‑column layout, button, and alert.  
Part 2 uses Tailwind CSS utilities to create a responsive card with image and CTA.  
Part 3 uses React.js to build an interactive component with props and useState.  
  
The Bootstrap and Tailwind demos are static HTML pages.  
The React demo is hosted in CodeSandbox and forkable for collaboration.
